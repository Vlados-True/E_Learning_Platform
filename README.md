# E_Learning_Platform

I have successfully created a content management system that effectively manages users, groups, and permissions. I have utilized model inheritance to efficiently 
handle polymorphic content within the system. Additionally, I have built a robust REST API using Django REST Framework, enabling seamless communication and data 
manipulation. Moreover, I have developed a real-time chat feature by integrating WebSockets with Django Channels, enabling instant messaging and live updates. 
Additionally, I have implemented custom middleware to cater to specific requirements, ensuring smooth and secure system operations. Furthermore, I have successfully 
implemented custom Django management commands for streamlined administrative tasks
